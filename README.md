Once the program is running:

1. The program will ask you if you'd like to run in debug mode which prints out swapping information

2. Type yes (y) or no (n) to toggle the debug mode

3. The program will then ask you to enter 7 characters, upper or lower case, with no spaces

4. Based on your debug mode choice the program will either print the swapping information and then
   the final result or go straight to printing the result of alphabetically order all lowercase
   characters
